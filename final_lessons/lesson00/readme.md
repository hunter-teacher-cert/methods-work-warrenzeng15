## Loops (while loops)

### Overview

Lesson00 - What is a loop in computer programming? How can we use a "while" statement to make loops?  
Presuming that this will be the first time many of my students will be seeing the concept of iterations/loops, it will be important to show them an example code of a loop in action. I also have a few physical examples that could be useful in order to express it in a kinetic or visual way, but ultimately I think students seeing the code will be very important.  
  
Afterwards, instead of having students jump into writing while loops on their own, I think it will be good to have code tracing problems for them to work on in order for them to really get into thinking about how computers act when they are executing a while loop. (It helps them understand what it means to be the "iterator", which will be good for the next lesson about for loops). Being successful at code tracing will also give students confidence that they understand the concept, and is also a good way for the teacher to get a pulse of the room.  
  
There might even be room for scaffolded code similar to what I thought up for 06_scaffold, where I had heavily scaffolded Game of Nim that was focused on having students fill in the blanks in the program -- filling in the conditions for the conditional statements/loops in the code. This could be added at the end of the lesson if students speed through the code tracing problems, or if the lesson ends up taking class periods.I have yet to finish formulating the exact lesson structure (in terms of stuff like a powerpoint presentation/lecture, the materials for live-coding and code tracing, differentiation, the warm-up activity, etc), but I think this is a solid preliminary plan for now.



## Intro (5 - 7 min)
### Aim: What is a loop in computer programming? How can we use a "while" statement to make loops?  

### Do Now: 



## Short powerpoint slide/lecture to introduce loops (5 - 7 min)
Materials in folder

## Live coding activity (15min)
Materials in folder  
Using a live-code demonstration, students will be shown an example of a while loop(s) in action. 
  

## Code tracing (15-20 min/end of class)
Materials in folder  
Students work in their table groups to complete a worksheet with code tracing problems centered on while loops.
