### Learning Objective:
The main goal of this short excercise is to have students practice writing conditions for while loops and if statements. Since this program is that of a game and has several different parts to it, 
I am only asking students to fill in certain pieces of missing code throughout the program, particularly in if statements and the while loops. There is also a do-while loop present, so that students can see the slight difference between the two.  
Students will also have to practice reading through the code in order to understand what the program is doing, but ultimately the focus is on loops and how to write conditions for them.


### What I kept/removed:
I kept pretty much the entire structure of the program, and only removed the conditions throughout the program. I decided to do this because I intended for this activity to be short and heavily focused on the conditions. 
I also felt that removing too much of the program and having students fill it in would detract from the learning objective, so ultimately I am sacrificing having students do more actual programming in order for me to focus on just one aspect of programming.


### Any other add/deletes:
I think it may be good to describe to the students right before the activity how this game of Nim works. Maybe I could show them the program working, but not the code, so that they have a better idea of what the program is doing.
I could also choose to remove the print statements entirely at several different points of the program, and then have students write the if statements entirely.   
For example, I could leave the if statements for the win condtiions on lines 28 and 38 empty, and simply comment an instruction that tells students 
"This is where we will check if there is a winner in the game. Please write an if statement to complete this part of the program".  

In hindsight, it may be better for students to have more work to do, as I feel like this activity could be completed very quickly. It would be good to have 1 or 2 other similar examples, where there is an almost complete program
that is simply missing the conditions for it's while statements. This way students will be able to have more to practice/work on if they finish this too quickly, or would like a challenge (essentially also a way to add differentitaion).
