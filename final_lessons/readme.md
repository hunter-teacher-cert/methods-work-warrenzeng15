### Overview
These two lesson plans are intended for high schoolers, particuarly 10th, 11th and maybe 12th grade (assuming no prior programming experience).   
This will be for an "Intro to Computer Science" course.

  
For the 10th and 11th graders, I assume that they are a proficient in algebra1/2 at the very minimum. Since there will be a blend of different skill levels, these lesson plans 
will very much be simplified as an intro course to Computer Science, and will probably require careful/strategic differentiation. 
The two lesson plans will be used toward the beginning of the course, and lesson 01 will be designed to follow up right after
lesson 00, although it may be necessary to extend the length of lesson00 over 2 days, or have another lesson to solidify lesson00 before students move on, etc.
