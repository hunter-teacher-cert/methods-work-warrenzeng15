# Community Building Techniques

### Target Environment: School

School Attributes: (using data from my own school)
* school size: 540
* school grade range: 9 -12 
* faculty count: 1-2
* courses: 2-4

### Club/Organization: Tech Club (or STEM club?)

#### How It Works
 This would be an after school club that would meet once a week (or more, if there is a lot of student demand). Similar to the dojo, it will be an open space for students to either do work or it could just be a place for 
students to hangout or play around with tech at the school (for example, the school 3d printer, or maybe to just use some of the more powerful computers at the school to work on projects, such as coding/animating/machine learning/ai, etc.).
I think there is even room to have videogames in a club like this -- maybe not like an esports team or anything, but at least one or two computers that students could game on. Another idea I have is to get a VR headset or two, because there are a lot of cool
things that students can have the opportunity to do with VR (aside from games, they could even do like 3d sculpting/art/gamemaking, etc. 

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
  I would expect to see students having fun! This club can be partly a way for students to get more into the tech field outside of the classroom, but also a stress reliever -- a place and time where they can just relax and do fun things for an hour or two after school with their friends.

#### Rollout Timeline
* How long should this take to implement, come to fruition...  
  - It shouldn't take very long to establish the club, but growing it into a community may take some time, and probably a little bit of advertising. There also needs to be a small core group of students that come up with ideas or organize 
events/things for everyone to do in order for it to continue being fun/exciting from week to week. 

* Significant milestones along the way?  
  -  funding the club may be a significant milestone if the school does not have a budget to spare for cool tech stuff/computers

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
How will you know it is working?
  - I think seeing students excited to show up to the club and make/see friends in the club while having something fun to do after school will be a good way to gauge efficacy. Ultimately the goal is to get more student engagement, both engaged in
tech related topics, but also just to be engaged in being at school in general. 

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
Admin may view the club as not academic focused and thus not make it an official club, or not provide any school funding for it. I think if this became an issue, we would have to try and lean into the club being a little bit more of a 
tutoring enviornment, where students can get help from older students on homework for math/comp sci.
