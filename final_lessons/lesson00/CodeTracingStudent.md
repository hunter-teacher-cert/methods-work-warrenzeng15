### Trace through each piece of code and write out what it the computer will output!


1.
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 3){
  System.out.println("Hi!");
i = i + 1;
}
```
What does the code output?  
answer:  



2.
```java
int i = 3;
while (i > 0){
  System.out.println("Hi!");
i = i - 1;
}
System.out.println("Bye!");
```
What does the code output?  
answer:  



3. 
``` java
int i = 3;
while (i < 6) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i += 1;    // i+=1 is the same as i = i +1;
}
```
What does the code output?  
answer:  


4. 
``` java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;          // i++ is the same as i +=1; 
}
```
What does the code output?  
answer:  



5. 
``` java
int i = 10;
while (i >= 1) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i--;          
}
```
What does the code output?  
answer:  



6.
```java
int i = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
    System.out.println(i*2);        
}

```

answer:  



7.
``` java
int x = 3;
int i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  x += 1;
  i += 1;
}
System.out.println(x);

```
