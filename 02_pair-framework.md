# Pair programming in the lens of a music conductor + musicians

### Conductor = navigator  
### Musicians = driver
  
  
Conductors must direct their musicians in order to play a wonderful piece of music in the right time/rhythm , the right tune, etc. 
They work together with the musicians in order to figure out what parts of the musical piece they need to practice more or are incorrect, but it's really up to the musicians to be the ones playing the music.  
  
In pair programming, one person is the navigator (conductor) and the other is the driver (musician). They must work together in order to solve the problem/task at hand, 
with the navigator calling the shots and creating the path for the driver and the driver doing the actual programming. As you can see, its very similar to the way a conductor and a music group performs a piece of music!  


Answers to the questions:    
1. Similar to how rally driving split up the two roles, there is one role of a conductor (which can be viewed as the navigator) and the other as the group of musicians (the drivers). The conductor directs the musicians and makes sure they are on track/on task, and is also the one to make 
important decisions as well as the one that reviews how the musicians are playing in order to catch people out of tune/out of time (similar to catching bugs in a program!)  
2. I think this will definitely be approachable in classrooms where there are a lot of students that in music classes, or have been in music classes in the past. It's a familiar concept and may be a little more exciting as it will remind them of an activity they do in an elective/art class.
3. Students will buy into it because conductors are often seen as a sort of natural process for orchestras/concert bands.
It makes the concept look intuitive; there are two driving forces in programming, one is the the process of thinking through the problem, and the other is actually putting it into the editor in the form of code. Having students see the separation of these two processes in the frame of music makes it easier for them to follow.
4. I think the strongest aspect is that it makes it clear that the conductor/navigator is in charge. Looking at the image above, you can see that the conductor looks like they're in a position of power -- 
this is great for those students that may get antsy in the navigator seat, because they are frustrated and want to type the answers in themselves. With the framework of being a conductor, they may feel more empowered to direct their musician/driver rather than just resort to stealing the keyboard.
Another strength is that it reminds you that the driver is also extremely important -- the conductor can't make any music without the musicians playing their instruments, they'd just be waving a stick in the air like a maniac! The musicians/driver role gets a spotlight in that regard as well, so overall it makes both roles look cool.
5. The biggest weakness is obvious -- students that have never been in a music class/group with a conductor is still foreign to them, so it won't be as effective of a comparison for them. 
It may also be intimidating for students to imagine themselves in the role of a conductor, as that would usually be the role that their teacher would have.
