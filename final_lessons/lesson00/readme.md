# Lesson00 - Loops (while loops)
This lesson is intended to be taught to high school students, grades 10-12. The materials are presented in Java, so it can be used for either AP CS A or an Introduction to Computer Science class (either in Java, or adapted to another language). 

Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards: 9-12.CT.7, 9-12.CT.8 

### Overview
Students start with a quick excercise reviewing if/else statements and conditions in the Do Now. This will lead into the introduction of loops through a lecture using a few slides. Students will get the formal definition/explanation of the concept and then see a few examples in the slides.

I think it will be good to have code tracing problems for them to work on at this point, in order for them to really get into thinking about how computers act when they are executing a while loop. (It helps them understand what it means to be the "iterator", which will be good for the next lesson about for loops). Being successful at code tracing will also give students confidence that they understand the concept, and is also a good way for the teacher to get a pulse of the room.  

It will be important to show students an example code of a loop in action, which is why the lesson will then shift to a live-coding demo. I also have a few physical examples that could be useful in order to express it in a kinetic or visual way (that could be used during the introduction or during the powerpoint slides), but ultimately I think students seeing the code itself will be very important. By using a little bit of a more intermediate/lenghtier program compared to the code tracing problems, students are able to see how while loops can fit into a larger program and why it is so essential. 

At the very end, there will be a short exit ticket where students write a code block utilizing a while statement, related to a question posed in the Do Now. This will be a good culmination of the lesson, and the teacher will be able to assess whether or not students have been able to grasp the concept of while loops.

**Idea for a follow-up lesson/homework:**   
There might even be room for scaffolded code similar to what I thought up for 06_scaffold, where I had heavily scaffolded Game of Nim that was focused on having students fill in the blanks in the program -- filling in the conditions for the conditional statements/loops in the code. This could be added at the end of the lesson if students speed through the code tracing problems, or if the lesson ends up taking class periods.

# Lesson Structure
## Intro (3 - 5 min)
### Aim: What is a loop in computer programming? How can we use a "while" statement to make loops?  

### Do Now: 

Review on if/else statements -- with a focus on the condition. This will lead into the main lesson (conditions of a while loop), and will also be related to the exit ticket. (included in slides)

## Short powerpoint slide/lecture to introduce loops (7 - 10 min)
Materials in folder. Can also use a physical example or two during the explanation

## Code tracing (10-15 min)
Materials in folder  
Students work in their table groups to complete a few short code tracing problems centered on while loops. One problem will be done as an entire class as an example.
Afterwards, review a couple of the problems.

## Live coding activity (15 min)
Materials in folder  
Using a live-code demonstration, students will be shown an example of a while loop in action. This section can also be prefaced by showing examples from the code tracing problems 

## Exit ticket (3-5 min/whatever time is left)
Follow up to the Do Now
