## Loops contd. (for loops)
This lesson is meant to be a follow-up to lesson00, (although retrospectively, it may be worthwhile to expand on while loops for another class period or two in order to solidify student's knowledge of it). As such, the same target audience is applicable here -- students in grades 10-12 in an Intro to CS course or AP CS A.

Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards: 9-12.CT.7, 9-12.CT.8, 9-12.CT.10

### Overview
Structurally, this lesson is similar to lesson00. Students will start with a Do Now involving while loops as a warm-up for the rest of the lesson. The teacher will then transition to the slideshow with an introduction to for loops.
Students will see a couple of examples of for loops, although in terms of the genereal concept of loops, they will have already established it during the previous lesson. 

Next, students will do a quick trace diagrama activity. This is used to the same effect as the code tracing activity in lesson00 -- it is a way for students to practice for loops without jumping right into writing their own programs.
Students will once again "get into the mind" of a computer which will help solidify their learning. Again, this is also a good strategy for the teacher to see the pulse of the room. 

After reviewing the trace diagrams, students should have a good idea of how for loops work, and have seen examples of for loops in action. This is where I decided to have them do a pair programming activity, involving 
a couple of for loops. The solution may not come to students very quickly because this is their first time working with for loops, which is why this is a collaborative activity. The code will be scaffolded with enough structure so that students 
can focus on the main point of the lesson. Students will have the rest of the class time to finish.

## Intro (3-5 min)
### Aim: What is a for loop and how can we use it in computer programming?  

### Do Now: 

Review on while loops as a warm-up excercise. (Included in slides)


## Short powerpoint slide/lecture to introduce loops (5 - 7 min)
Materials in folder


## Trace diagrams of a for loop (7-10 min)
Directions/example in  the slides. Class will come back together to show off the trace diagram (student volunteers and/or the teacher does it live).


## Pair programming (25 min - end of class)
(w/ scaffolding)  
This is under the assumption that students have already been introduced to pair programming. Students will work in pairs to complete writing a program that requires the use of for loops. 
One student will be the navigator, and the other the driver. They have the rest of class to work on this.
